    "### Your Own Data-Driven Insight\n",
    "Come up with a unique insight by analyzing the data in a way that hasn't been considered in the previous questions. You might examine other variables or charting options for instance. Your insight should be easily stated in a sentence or two, or captured by a chart that could be similarly explained in a caption. Spend some time trying to make your insight something that could be a headline for a news article - that could entail some type of surprising result, social inequity, or implication for education policy. Be sure to show your entire code and process for deriving your insight. "

    "Take the first college ranking (i.e. \"Schools That Make Financial Sense\") discussed in the following article and \"re-create\" it as best you can using the original data to compute a rating score. Note the methodology at the end of the article carefully, but realize that your actual ratings and ranking will NOT exactly match the ranking shown in the article. The reason for this is that the filtering of schools was done qualitatively (by the journalist) and is therefore not repeatable in a data-driven way.\n",

We also filter out trade-specific schools and religious programs like seminaries and yeshivas. There are also a few limitations to the income data that the government released. Incomes reported in the data set include only students who took out federal loans from the government.
